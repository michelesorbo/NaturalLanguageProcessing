Amazon Customer;Great With Modifications;The recovery times are longer as some have mentioned, but I like to do active recoveries and mix in some cardio, so I jog, do jumping jacks, high knees, etc. during the recovery. Since my workouts are usually 50 minutes, and this is a backup, I will modify the different exercises on different rounds as well. For example, do static lunge squats or backwards lunges instead of just lunges. This makes the workout more challenging and keeps me from boredom. The only thing I don’t like is you can’t pick your music. Overall, this app is just like any workout - it’s yours, do what you want with it.;4.5
Janey_monster;Won't take 'Yes' for an answer!;Just like another reviewer said. Between exercises, when it asks if your ready to start, I say yes and it says "okay I'll keep that in mind for next time.... Blah blah blah..." and closes me out before I finish my set. If not for that, and maybe also not knowing what a 'burpee' is (perhaps I'm a bit behind on exercise vocabulary... But a description option would be nice!), I'd rate 5. Please fix?? (P. S. I have an echo dot 2nd gen); 2
Gary Mercado;Won't respond to my yes command;The skill won't respond to the yes command and basically makes me restart mid workout.other than that when it works it's great.;2
Amazon Customer;Excellent;So far I’m happy of this new Skill. I don’t have time to go to the gym but the 15-minute workouts suits my mornings well. The intensity of the sessions is tailored to my modest standards too.;5
Linda Charlton-Gunderson;Does not always hear ready;I said ready and she would shut off. But when it works it's fine but the recover is too long. It started all over when she told me it was done and asked if it was too easy or too hard. I said it was ok.;2
Mallory galvin;Terrible;Slow and annoying. I don't need 30 seconds to recover from 30 seconds of push ups.;1
Amazon Customer;Challenging;I love bodyweight workouts and they look well-structured from a scientific point of view. I’m curious to know how many different exercises it can generate and how far they will push me.;5
jenisse210;Great idea but doesn't work;I've tried to start twice now and I get to start work outs and she asks if I want music with my workout. I say yes and she shuts off! Did it to me twice!!;2
Matteo;Fantastic!!!;I've never seen something like that, I am a bit passionate about these topics and the trainings (including the evolution of a training) is well structured. Definitely I can see the work of a fitness expert in the preparation of the training. So I totally advice it.;5
Amazon Customer;Five Stars;I tried the app and it's the best one for my daily workout!! Recommended! A+;5
aisha;Great but needs improvement;Great app if it just don't shut itself off time to time and destroys your work out in between;4
Rebekah Bertram;love it;my kids do this woth me. i kove it. great music and quick!;5
